This work is under progress

The aim is to write an legal-focused article exposing how MISP (https://github.com/MISP/MISP) embraces and support the GDPR ( REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the 
free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

All contributions are welcome.

This is a very early draft in progress.
