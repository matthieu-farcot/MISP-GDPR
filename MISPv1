Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) is a platform for sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromises of targeted attacks.
It allows organizations to share information about malware and their indicators. MISP users benefit from the collaborative knowledge about existing malware or threats. The aim of this trusted platform is to help improving the counter-measures used against targeted attacks and set-up preventive actions and detection.

The current legal and regulatory framework is often seen as a challenge for such platforms, especially regarding data protection. The goal of this document is to clarify the fact that important legal grounds regarding the protection of personnal data are not only in favor of information sharing but that platforms such as MISP are an essential tool in order for the actors implied in data protection to fulfill their duties.

The demonstration hereafter exposed is based for the most part on the General Data Protection Regulation, as described in the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

# Information sharing is an essential activity for all implied actors in personnal data protection as described within the GDPR
## Micro-level (data controllers):
The case of Data Controllers, as indicated in the GDPR introduction, Section (49),
“The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems.”

MISP, by allowing the data controller to have access to a threat sharing platform, should be perceived as an essential tool in order to resist to any compromise to availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored personnel data. Data controllers, as responsible for such security, need to be made aware of the existence of any potential breach or threat.

MISP also helps Data controllers in fulfilling security proactive obligations, as seen section 87 of the GDPR introduction – “It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject.”

CHAPTER II Principles, Article 5 Principles relating to processing of personal data
1. Personal data shall be:
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

AND

Article 39 Tasks of the data protection officer
1. The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks:
(…)
(b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits;

## Macro-level (regulators and supervisory authorities)
MISP helps all implied regulators in monitoring the level of protection for personnal data in third countries, as stated in section 106 (introduction to GDPR):
“The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources. The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the Council.”
Such review needs information sharing on existing technical threats to security.

Moreover, MISP is an essential tool to support supervisory authorities in Member States in fulfilling their obligations:

(Section 117) The establishment of supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure.

AND

(Section 120) Each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget, which may be part of the overall state or national budget.

AND

(section 133) The supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority.

# MISP as an essential asset for threats on information systems Metrology

(section 107) The Commission may recognise that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules, and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.

Section 3 Data protection impact assessment and prior consultation Article 35 Data protection impact assessment
1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
(…)
7. The assessment shall contain at least:
(…)
c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; (…)
